# Balls in the wind

#### Video Demo:  <URL HERE>

#### Description:

* Use arrow keys to control the wind and attempt to align the balls in the correct order. 
* Press Enter to Capture the position (in flight okay).
* I've never managed to go till the 6 balls' stage by playing fairly. Will you manage to reach this last stage and clear it? :)​

CS50x's final project. It's coded in C and exported in js/wasm with emscriptem. All the interactions are coded as force vectors applied to the balls. It's inspired by the Nature of Code, excellent Javascript Edutainment on Daniel Shiffman's Coding Train channel.
